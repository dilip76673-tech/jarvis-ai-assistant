# 🤖 JARVIS – AI Voice Assistant

JARVIS is a **Python-based AI Voice Assistant** that can listen to user commands,
process them, and respond using **text-to-speech** with a natural voice.
It is designed as a simple desktop assistant inspired by smart assistants.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
JARVIS listens to voice input, understands commands, and responds with speech.
The project demonstrates practical use of **speech recognition**, **text-to-speech**,
and basic AI logic in Python.

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Microphone captures user voice  
2. Voice is converted to text  
3. Command is processed by logic  
4. JARVIS generates a response  
5. Response is spoken using TTS

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python  
- Edge TTS (Text-to-Speech)  
- Playsound  
- AsyncIO
